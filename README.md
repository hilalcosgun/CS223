# CS223 - Digital Design Labs
These are the labs I coded in SystemVerilog using Vivado and BASYS FPGA for the CS223 course.
The course covers fundamental digital design topics such as number systems, logic levels, transistors, and gates. It includes Boolean algebra, combinational and sequential circuits, FSM design, and timing analysis. Additionally, it introduces Verilog modeling for both combinational and sequential circuits, registers, counters, ALU design, and programmable hardware like FPGAs.
